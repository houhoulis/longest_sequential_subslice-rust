This is code I wrote as a 15-minute exercise to help out a [research project](https://research.exercism.io/) at [Exercism](https://exercism.io). Exercism is a free, open-source, volunteer-driven learning and mentoring platform. It offers thousands of exercises spread across 50+ programming language tracks.

This little project is a binary crate, but I wrote tests for it. This repo is just to show a way to test a binary crate. (See http://xion.io/post/code/rust-unit-test-placement.html.) But... the Exercism research project sounds intriguing, so here's a bit more info:

> _**Please help us by solving some 15-minute challenges**_
>
> Our first experiment explores how people think differently based on the programming languages they know, and how we use that understanding to improve the way we teach new languages.
>
> How does your experience affect how you code?
>
> We are exploring how the order and depth in which someone learns programming languages affects how they solve different problems. We will use this learning to extrapolate how we can better teach new programming languages to people from different backgrounds.
>
> We hope that you will participate in both languages that you barely know and languages that you know well.

The research project is [live](https://research.exercism.io/experiments/1), as of right now (Oct 30, 2020), should you be inclined.
